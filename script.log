2020-05-11 08:30:19,819 - __main__ - no I want you to write down every single thing I say
2020-05-11 08:32:16,962 :  write down everything I'm saying
2020-05-11 08:32:27,613 :  not particularly but just let me know what I'm saying
2020-05-11 09:22:32,846 :  alright let's see how this works out
2020-05-11 09:22:41,243 :  yes
2020-05-11 09:23:49,442 :  in theory this will be dictated
2020-05-11 09:23:57,430 :  everything that I say will be prescribed
2020-05-11 09:24:05,007 :  I don't know if this is going to work but we're trying
2020-05-11 09:24:12,511 :  I don't really think that I have anything going
2020-05-11 09:24:21,394 :  but that's okay we're chilling this is working quite well
2020-05-11 09:24:29,993 :  I don't know how I'm going to acquire all this knowledge but
2020-05-11 09:24:36,752 :  it's definitely going to be interesting
2020-05-11 09:24:44,944 :  it's kind of fun to know when this stuff
2020-05-11 09:24:52,317 :  when it's restarting it's
2020-05-11 09:24:59,928 :  redoing its little queries
2020-05-11 09:27:34,805 :  Dictation Started
2020-05-11 09:27:42,084 :  well here we are
2020-05-11 09:27:42,085 :  Dictation Started
2020-05-11 09:27:51,064 :  in theory this should be all I need to just keep on dictating
2020-05-11 09:27:51,065 :  Dictation Started
2020-05-11 09:27:55,600 :  possibly need
2020-05-11 09:27:55,601 :  Dictation Started
2020-05-11 09:28:05,840 :  you seem to be a 1 or 2 second lag time
2020-05-11 09:28:05,841 :  Dictation Started
2020-05-11 09:29:00,372 :  Dictation Started
2020-05-11 09:29:07,947 :  I'm curious how it changes with a increased time
2020-05-11 09:29:07,948 :  Dictation Started
2020-05-11 09:29:23,038 :  kind of annoying that it doesn't seem to be working as well
2020-05-11 09:29:23,039 :  Dictation Started
2020-05-11 09:29:35,543 :  what can I do to make this better and I possibly use two threads
2020-05-11 09:29:35,544 :  Dictation Started
2020-05-11 09:29:47,733 :  or can I use like a counter that would be nice showing at counter of like what the current timing is
2020-05-11 09:29:47,734 :  Dictation Started
2020-05-11 10:18:19,859 :  I dish it has got to be lit I need to know that this is going to be f******
2020-05-11 10:18:26,212 :  if it's not sick then I'm going to be so f****** sad is better
2020-05-11 10:18:31,328 :  you working and it better be dictating every f****** thing that I say
2020-05-11 10:22:46,920 :  alright so it has to be processing text every single time currently
2020-05-11 10:22:49,494 :  and it's not just going to
2020-05-11 10:22:53,679 :  f****** do something else
2020-05-11 10:36:08,511 :  this is the one that works it works quite well
2020-05-11 10:36:14,657 :  there's nothing about it that I'm worried about is it's always going to work
2020-05-11 10:36:18,545 :  I know it's always can be dictating exactly what I say
2020-05-11 10:36:27,808 :  it may cut off a single word or two
2020-05-11 10:36:35,915 :  but that's no big deal because I get the gaps and I can change the gaps
2020-05-11 10:36:38,002 :  kind of command
2020-05-11 10:38:17,740 :  I'm trying to think about how this will affect us
2020-05-11 10:38:25,113 :  I've no idea
2020-05-11 10:38:33,509 :  is it going to call my callback function that doesn't exist
2020-05-11 10:38:41,701 :  Maybe
2020-05-11 11:13:59,733 :  this should be the correct implementation for a long-term situation
2020-05-11 11:14:05,877 :  it should be documenting everything that we have.
2020-05-11 11:14:08,130 :  books
2020-05-11 11:14:16,958 :  everything is 100% accurate
2020-05-11 11:14:21,852 :  not everything
2020-05-11 11:14:26,974 :  however
2020-05-11 11:14:35,777 :  there comes a time when you have to figure it out
2020-05-11 11:15:44,796 :  what will we find here
2020-05-11 11:25:17,453 :  this is a test
